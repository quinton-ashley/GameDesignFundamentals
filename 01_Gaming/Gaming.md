## What’s the difference between a hard-core vs a casual approach to gaming?

When taking a hard-core approach, players want to be challenged with more complex games they can research and obsess over to optimize their play.
When taking a casual approach, players want to be entertained with games that have a simple premise so they can pick up and play easily.
People don’t exclusively take a casual or hard-core approach to every game they play.

“Instrumental play is a goal-orientated approach that values efficiency, expertise and optimizing strategies as part of play. Crudely put, in instrumental play the point of the playing is not just to reach the end, but to find the best way of getting there (Taylor, 2006). Instrumental play may also be referred to as ‘min-maxing’, ‘power gaming’ or ‘hardcore gaming’. A central feature of this approach is a deep understanding of the game system, which enables one to take advantage of inherent favorable combinations or configurations hidden in the game mechanics, as well as joy in doing so. Instrumental play has received much attention from game studies scholars (eg. Chen, 2012; Eklund & Johansson, 2013; Malone, 2009; Taylor, 2009) as it challenges romantic notions of play as something frivolous, light 5 and enjoyed for its own sake. This tension has also been noted by players who characterize the dedication of power gamers as ‘over the top’. Power gamers are often accused of having no social life outside the game, even for playing incorrectly, by taking the game too seriously. Empirical studies of instrumental power gamers have however shown how they tend to be integral social actors in player communities exactly because of their dedication. In a game where perseverance is a virtue, power gamers are understood as productive and skilled participants whose expertise is sought after and admired (Taylor, 2006). Furthermore, these studies show that a serious approach to play does not exclude fun. Instead enjoyment stem from achieving set goals, finding good strategies and gaining insight into the underlying structures of the game (Consalvo et al., 2010), and serves as a reminder of how games are sites for a wide range of engagements and types of enjoyment (Kallio, Mäyrä, & Kaipainen, 2011).”

Can you think of any “hard-core” gamers who you admire for their intense dedication to a game?

Is it always desirable to be good at a game?

No, if people don’t like a game, they won’t want to play it at all!
If people do like a game, it’s often desirable for them to achieve a game’s objectives, even when playing a game “just for fun”. But this isn’t always the case. For example, playing a game poorly on purpose against an inexperienced opponent to teach them how the game is played.

Have you ever played a video game that rewards players for being “bad” at it?

Skate 3 is a skateboarding video game that rewards players for completing tricks. It also has a reward system for counting how many bones the player character breaks after a fall! Players can even unlock achievements for really bad falls. Which technically makes it a form of playing the game well, to get all the fall damage achievements you must find the worst places to fall in the game.

“Instrumental play tends towards optimization which can often result in un-fun player behaviors. This gets extended out to the extreme [by the media and some academics], where play framed around challenge or investment is treated as irrational or somehow less genuine than some hypothetically more pure, innocent, unadulterated version of play: unconcerned with doing well. It’s important in this conversation to establish firmly that this is a false dichotomy. [...] they’re not antithetical concepts. Rather than being in conflict with one another they’re in tension, there’s not an opposed relationship but there is a complex one. Because if you back up and think about it, it’s easy to appreciate how someone can find deep enjoyment in improving a skill, achieving goals, and discovering solutions to complex problems. Rather, instrumental play, play focussed on goals, can be juxtaposed with free play. A form of play that is without ending, neither free or instrumental play can exist in their purest form, [...]”

Have you ever engaged in free play with a work of interactive digital art that you wouldn’t categorize as a video game?

When I was in middle school the iPhone was brand new. There were a few apps that gained popularity perhaps only because the 3.5 inch touch screen of the iPhone was such a novel concept. I downloaded an app that displayed a fixed camera top down view of a Koi Pond. Players could tap on the screen to disperse food for the Koi fish and the fish would swim over to eat the food. If you held your finger on the screen

Why can't free play exist in its purest form?

humans are natural game designers, we naturally create little games when engaging in free play
