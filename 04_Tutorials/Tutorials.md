# Tutorials

As a teacher, I'm especially fascinated by the methods that game designers use to teach players how to play a game.

In education there's a spectrum between telling a person exactly what to do vs. letting them figure it out on their own.

If you design your game so that players have to figure out how to play it all on their own, that might be frustrating to players that don't like to learn things via trial and error. They might complain that they had no idea what they were supposed to do and may ask, "What's the point of this game?".

However, if you design your game so that players are told exactly what to do, that might be boring. Some player might complain that the game was treating them like a child, holding their hand the whole time. They might quit the game without ever getting past the tutorial.

Therefore designing good tutorial sections can be a challenging task.

## What's the most famous video game that has no tutorial?

When early versions of MineCraft were released, the game had absolutely no in-game tutorial. It just spawned players into a algorithmically generated world without giving them any intrinsic goal or directions. Players had to figure everything out on their own.

The difficulty of surviving the first night in MineCraft could vary wildly. The player could spawn right near a village, with food, shelter, and light, which prevents enemies from spawing near them. Thus, they'd completely bypass some of the main challenges faced by beginners in survival mode: finding food, making shelter, and all the crafting and exploration required to make a torch. If the player spawned on an island in the middle of an ocean, they might find acheiving these goals far more difficult.

The first step to making a wood pickaxe, the most basic tool for mining in the game, is punching a tree with your character's bare hands to get wood from it. An action that's so un-intuitive and absurd that it became an instant meme. The game doesn't tell players how to make a crafting table, it doesn't even tell players that they exist or what they're for. Even players that had seen other people play the game may have never seen them use a crafting table.

This may seem like a horrible design, but it paid homage to retro games like The Legend of Zelda for NES, in which the title screen text crawl instructs the player to read the manual to learn more about the game. The MineCraft wiki assumes a similar role.

The lack of in-game tutorial sections might've actually boosted the game's popularity in its early days. Early players made their own tutorials on YouTube, which helped spread the word about the game.

I'm so old that I remember asking my friends for help on single player games instead of consulting the internet. In Super Mario Sunshine, the game doesn't tell you how to unlock the final level. I was the first in my friend group to learn that you didn't have to collect all the Shine Sprites, you just had to defeat Shadow Mario in every area of Delfino Island.

In many games, tutorials involve the player reading text on the screen, but more creative game designers make their tutorials interactive.

I want you to try to think creatively about how to make your own original games. People want to play games that seem new and unique to them. Making a port of an existing game can be a good educational experience and could even be a profitable venture. But during this course, you can take inspiration from games you've played, but don't make direct ports or inferior copies.

Super Mario Maker 2 already exists! The world doesn't need another generic Super Mario clone.

The 2D platformer genre has become extremely saturated over the last 50 years. Even though there has been real innovation in the genre recently, with games like Celeste, it's still very difficult to make a unique 2D platformer.
