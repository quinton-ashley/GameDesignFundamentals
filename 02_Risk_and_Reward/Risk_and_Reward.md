# Risk and Reward
---

challenges can be motivating and rewarding. When we overcome a challenge, we often feel a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, which can boost our self-esteem and confidence.

Another reason is that challenges can help us learn and grow. When we are faced with a challenge, we are often forced to think creatively and critically in order to find a solution. This process of problem-solving can help us develop new skills and knowledge, and can also help us become more adaptable and resilient.

Additionally, some people may simply find the process of tackling a challenge to be enjoyable in and of itself. The sense of excitement and anticipation that comes with facing a challenge can be part of the appeal.

Overall, the desire to be challenged may be tied to our basic human need for growth and development. By seeking out and facing challenges, we can continue to learn and improve throughout our lives.

In a famous episode of The Twilight Zone, a thief dies and finds himself in heaven: or so he thinks.

He gets all the money he wants, lives in the nicest apartment in the city, has power over everyone, and has multiple beautiful wives that do as he pleases.

At first the man has a lot of fun in this world, but soon his illusions of it being a utopia unravels. He realizes that no one in this world is conscious besides him and his guardian angel, who turns out to be the devil.
