Who’s the best COD MW2 player of all time?

Let’s take a look and find out!

What does “being good” at a game even mean? It’s subjective!

In the MW2 clip killing the sniper as fast as possible and moving on to hopefully get another kill to boost one’s killstreak would technically be more optimal play. Yet, since we’re humans and not robots, using opportunities presented by the game world to show off one’s sense of humor can be considered a better way of playing the game.

The idea that the “correct” or “best” way to play a game is by achieving the game’s objectives, is a belief that players can choose to adhere to and impose on other players. It’s a value that game designers can try to instill in players, but it is not inherent, natural, or universal amongst players.

Share with the class a time you played a game or saw someone else play a game in an innovative or subversive way that the game designers might not have expected.

Example: speed running

“Even though World of Warcraft is built as a system with a formal structure of rules and goals, it is the movement of play between free and instrumental play that makes it difficult if not impossible to see it – or any other game for that matter – as a stable object. This quality of play as movement is not present in prevailing definitions of what constitutes a game, as destabilizing game structures through play makes it even harder to define them. For Malaby, who refers to the destabilizing nature of play as ‘process’, it is reason to argue that ‘any attempt to formalize games by defining them essentially in terms of their rules or through a taxonomy of types [...] falls short because it fails to capture how games are moving targets, capable of generating new, emergent effects that then inform the following instances of the game’ (Malaby 2007: 103). For a game like World of Warcraft, which offers a highly instrumental goal-driven structure of levels, quests and other objectives but, as a virtual world, also presents a space where players can play freely in unpredictable, innovative or subversive manners, the distinction between instrumental and free play is not conceptual but very real. Play in World of Warcraft, then, is not stable but rather the result of constant oscillations between free and instrumental play practices.”

For a more recent example, let's examine Fortnite.

Fortnite matches facilitate instrumental play with modes that have rules and clear objectives.

Contrast that with Fortnite loading areas, in which players can simply exist in a consequence-free limbo with no objective.

Why are Fortnite’s loading areas an example of good game design?

They provide an opportunity for free play in place of a non-interactive loading screen or menu screen.
They enable players to practice new strategies for subsequent instrumental play.
They enable players to make up their own little metagames, games within the game. For example tag, dance battles, and spray paint wars.

Have you ever made up a game within a game?

“Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.”

“play functions as a critical practice [...] players have transformed videogames into platforms for making metagames.”

What is a game’s meta?

Even when a game retains the same rules, new innovations in play styles can develop and spread through a player community, affecting how all players play the game. Adapting one’s own play style to how other players play is referred to as a game’s meta. The meta-game often requires players to master advanced techniques in order to be competitive.

---

Super Smash Bros. Melee, released in 2001, was designed to bring a competitive fighting game experience to young and casual gamers. Yet, Melee was designed so well that the game’s meta grew into a highly competitive e-sport, in which professional players have pushed high level competitions of the game way beyond the game designer’s expectations.
