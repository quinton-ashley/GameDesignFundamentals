Have you ever made up a game within a game?

“Metagame, Hypergame, or game about the game, is an approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.”

What is a game’s meta?

Even when a game retains the same rules, new innovations in play styles can develop and spread through a player community, affecting how all players play the game. Adapting one’s own play style to how other players play is referred to as a game’s meta. The meta-game often requires players to master advanced techniques in order to be competitive.

Super Smash Bros. Melee, released in 2001, was designed to bring a competitive fighting game experience to young and casual gamers. Yet, Melee was designed so well that the game’s meta grew into a highly competitive e-sport, in which professional players have pushed high level competitions of the game way beyond the game designer’s expectations.
